# Global Land Use Data Analyst
### *Project by Thea Francis*


![Rainforest Deforestation](image/Rainforest-deforestation.jpg) </br>
Half of the habitable land on our planet (areas free of ice and desert) is used for agriculture. The expanding agricultural landscape is the leading cause of deforestation.


## About the Project
This project aims to show that the majority of agricultural lands are allocated for raising livestock. The project also examines the dynamics of global land use over time, historical land use data, and the habitable land requirements associated with different national diets. The program produces visual representations, revealing trends across various countries and regions over time.


## Running the Program
1. Python 3 is required. This project is written using version 3.10.4.
2. Clone the repo from github.
3. Setup a virtual environment and activate it.
4. To make sure you have all the necessary packages, run
```
"pip install -r requirements.txt". 
```
 The following packages will be required to run the program: 
- pandas, 
- numpy, 
- matplotlib.pyplot, 
- scipy,
- seaborn </br>

To run the "main.ipynb" file, Jupyter Notebook needs to be installed. </br>

5. The program can be run directly by running "main.py" from the script folder. You can also run the "main.ipynb" file from script folder using Jupyter Notebook.



## Project Requirements

The following requirements have been met with this project:

1. **Read and analyze data from Two CSV files.**
- "global-land-use-since-10000bc.csv"
- "cereal_and_land_use_all_years_country.csv". 
- *All data are from ourworldindata.org* 

2. **Clean data and perform a pandas merge, then calculate some new values.** </br>
The project merged two CSV files. The datasets are cleaned and preprocessed in "clean.py". The merged file then used to calculate the proportion of total cereals allocated.

3. **Make a visualization with Bokeh** </br>
Two Plots are generated as output. 1 Bokeh chart is generated.

4. **Utilize a virtual environment and include instructions in your README on how the user should set one up.** </br>
This project uses a traditional VENV, it can be used with the included "requirements.txt" file.

5. **Annotate your .py files with well-written comments and a clear README.md (only applicable if youâ€™re not using a jupyter notebook).** </br>
This README file serves the purpose of providing comprehensive guidance to users.
