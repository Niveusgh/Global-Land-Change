Cereals fed to animals are not wasted: they are converted to meat and dairy, and consumed by humans in the end.
 But, in terms of calories and total protein, this process is very inefficient. 
  When you feed an animal, 
not all of this energy goes into producing additional meat, milk or eggs. 
Most is used to simply keep the animal alive. 

 beef has an energy efficiency of about 2%. 
 This means that for every 100 kilocalories you feed a cow, 
 you only get 2 kilocalories of beef back.
  In general we see that cows are the least efficient, 
 followed by lamb, pigs then poultry. 

 This is why eating less meat would mean eliminating 
 large losses of calories and thereby reduce the amount of farmland we need. 
 This would free up billions of hectares for natural vegetation,
  forests and ecosystems to return.

  Europe it’s less than one-third of cereal production is used for 
  human consumption, 
  and in the US only 10% is.

  7% of soy goes towards human foods such as tofu, tempeh, 
  soy milk and other substitute products. 
  Most of the rest goes towards oil production 
  which is split between soybean meal for animal feed 

  The expansion of land for agriculture is the leading driver 
  of deforestation and biodiversity loss.

  The expansion of pasture land to raise cattle was responsible for
   41% of tropical deforestation. That’s 2.1 million hectares every year – 
  about half the size of the Netherlands. 

  Half of the world’s habitable land ( ice- and desert-free land ) is used for agriculture, 
  with most of this used to raise livestock for dairy and meat.
   Livestock are fed from two sources – lands on which the animals
    graze and land on which feeding crops, 
  such as soy and cereals, are grown. 

  Habitat loss is the biggest threat to the world’s wildlife.
   Nearly all habitat loss is driven by the expansion of agriculture. 
   We chop down forests and convert wild grasslands into farmland 
  to grow crops and raise livestock.
